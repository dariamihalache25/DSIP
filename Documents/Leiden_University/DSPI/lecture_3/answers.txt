5 BOOT ORDER

6 SCREEN RESOLUTION
1. Current screen resolution: 1920x1080
2. When changing my screen orientation to portrait mode the screen rotated 90 degrees to the left.
3. I would not usually put my screen in portrait mode, but I might use it for social media apps or documents like eBooks that have a vertical layout. Portrait mode can show more lines at once, making it easier to read or browse.
4. When I changed the resolution to 800Ã—600 everything on the screen appeared larger. It also reduced clarity and limited how much content I could see at one time.
