Hex values for "world" is 77 6F 72 6C 64

Starting position in the file of the corresponding bytes of the phrase "hello world!" is 00001840

hello_world(1bit).bmp: pixel data starts at 3E 

hello_world(24bit).bmp: pixel data starts at 36

When I changed the extension from .txt to .exe and I tried to run the file it said that the app cannot run on my PC. Changing the extension did not change the bytes inside the file.

When I tried to change the file content from "hello_world.txt" it would not allow me to do that because it is read-only.
